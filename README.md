👋 Hey there! Some info about this project...

👩🏻‍💻This project was created as a project while enrolled in SheCodes coding workshop.

🛠I first mapped out the design by creating a wireframe, then began to code the app using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

🌱Creating this app helped give me a deeper understanding about APIS, how they work, and how to utilize them.
